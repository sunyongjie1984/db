Oracle PL/SQL Programming 5th Edition

Code Companion


The OPP5code.zip contains a wide variety of code used in this book. You are welcome to peruse the zip file directly, but you are better off using references to files in this zip as an "index" to its contents. To find a particular example on the book's web site, look for the filename cited in the text. For many examples, you will find filenames in the following form provided as a comment at the beginning of the example shown in the book, as shown here:

/* File on web: fullname.pkg */

If the code snippet in which you are interested does not have a "File on web" comment, then you should check the corresponding chapter code file . A chapter code file contains all the code fragments and examples that do not merit their own file, but that may prove useful to you for copy-and-paste operations. These files also contain the DDL statements to create tables and other objects on which the code may depend. The chapter code file is named chNN_code.sql, where NN is the number of the chapter.

The hr_schema_install.sql script will create the standard Oracle human resources demonstration tables, such as employees and departments. These tables are used in examples throughout the book.

Finally, unless otherwise noted in a file, you have the permission of the authors to use this code in your own application development efforts. Remember, however, that we do not guarantee any of this code to be bug-free. You are responsible for testing anything you choose to use!
